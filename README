dmioscope - track IO distribution with dmstats
==============================================

1. Introduction
===============

The dmioscope script provides a simple tool to track and visualise
the distribution of IO requests across a device's address space by
maintaining a histogram that counts IO requests by location.

The device can either be split into a fixed number of equally
sized regions (the same set of regions will be reported in each
successive update), or the script can attempt to adapt the number,
and size, of bins to the observed IO volumes: in this case the
set of bins (and their sizes) may change between updates.

The static mode is useful in order to obtain fixed, repeatable
statistics for measurement purposes: adaptive mode is best suited
to interactive use where the user is trying to get a rough idea
of the current IO distribution on the device.

The command accepts count and interval arguments to allow reports
to be continually generated from current data.


1.1 Histogram bins
------------------

Each bin in an ioscope histogram corresponds to a fixed range of
device sectors, for example, consider an 8MiB device divided into
eight bins:

   Bin:  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7
        +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 Count: |  0 | 10 |  0 | 50 | 15 | 0  | 90 | 77 |
        +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

In this case, each bin is of equal size (1MiB), although this need
not be the case generally.

The count for each bin indicates the number of matching IO events
that were observed in that bin for the current interval.

When plotted graphically, the area of each bin's plotted region is
proportional to the count of IOs observed in that region:

        0.0           20.0        40.0        60.0        80.0       100.0
         +-------------------------------------------------------------
0.0B     |
1.1MiB   |########
2.1MiB   |
3.1MiB   |################################
4.1MiB   |##########
5.1MiB   |
6.1MiB   |#######################################################
7.1MiB   |##################################################

If all bin sizes are uniform then the height of each bar corresponds to
the number of IOs observed in that region during the last interval.

If bin sizes are non-uniform then the height of the bar represents the
*frequency* of IO observed in that region: the absolute count of IOs is
proportional to the total area of the bar.

For example, a 300MiB region and a 100MiB region observing 300 IOs and
100 IOs respectively will be plotted as:

        0.0          100.0       200.0       300.0       400.0       500.0
         +------------------------------------------------------------
0.0B     |##############
         |##############
         |##############
300.1MiB |##############

Although the 300MiB region has three times the absolute number of IOs,
it is also three times larger and hence has the same frequency of IOs
per unit disk space:

  100 IOs / 100MiB
